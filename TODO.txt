Converter Pseudo Code

Step 1:
Load the file.

Step 2:
Process the file. Group by notes. Either a dict or a namedtuple can be used.

Step 3:
Sort notes by a given order. In this case, we need a list containing the order by which to sort.

The sorting algorithm must take (1) the note title (if any) and (2) the sort-order list.

Step 4:
Iterate over each note (a generator would be useful at this point) and add them to the Word document.
